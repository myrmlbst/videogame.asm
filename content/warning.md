**Small Warning Concerning the Code:**

This project, which is a collective effort between a small group of novice students, was written a few years ago in MIPS but was abandoned a little before its completion.
The game is currently **nonfucntional** and **doesn not run properly**.

If you'd like to try to debug it, make sure the latest version of Java is installed on your local machine and install MARS IDE.
