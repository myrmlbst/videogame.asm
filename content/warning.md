**Small Warning Concerning the Code:**

This project, which is a collective effort between a small group of novice students, was written a few years ago but was abandoned shortly before its completion.
The game is currently **nonfucntional** and **does not run properly** anymore.

If you'd like to try to debug it, make sure the latest version of Java is installed on your local machine and install MARS IDE. To check for official guides for these installations, refer to the ```README.md``` file in this repository, or go to the official [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) and [Missouri State](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm) websites.
